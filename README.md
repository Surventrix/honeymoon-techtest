## Tech test for Surventrix.

- Rails api (5.2) application
- Ruby version 2.3.1

First we need to get this repository cloned onto your machine

1. Clone repo onto your machine
2. Run `bundle install` to install the gems

Now that the repo has been setup on your machine, we want you to work through a few tasks to demonstrate your ability with Ruby on Rails. You don't have to complete all the tasks below, we are more interested in how you complete the solution.

To see some of the failing tests run `rails test`.

Tasks to complete

1. User model is not saving, this test must pass
2. Fix the Destination controller test
3. Rating model can only accept scores between 1 - 5
4. Ensure we can test the rating for the destination model
